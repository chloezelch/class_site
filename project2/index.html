    <h1>The New York Times Website</h1>
    <section class="flexarea">
       <p>The New York Times website is a massive journalism website housing original reporting, polling, and games. It aims to be a digital version of the physical New York Times newspaper, and has content from all sections of the paper. It also houses the New York Times Magazine, and special sections such as The Athletic for additional sports reporting and Wirecutter for e-commerce shopping.<br>

The website is based on a subscription model. A certain number of articles are free to read, but afterwards, you must subscribe to the Times to continue reading. The website is built to encourage users to keep reading and ultimately choose to subscribe.<br>

The homepage looks like a digital version of a newspaper front page, with several headlines neatly organized in boxes. There are big political headlines, as well as opinion pieces and articles from other sections. This aids the user in getting information quickly – if they only have time to scan headlines and read a blurb, they don’t even have to read or scroll. This is a very effective aspect of the New York Times website design. It feels natural, like opening a paper, and provides essential information to users at the first look.<br>

It can feel very overwhelming to see so much text on a homepage, but those choosing to go to the New York Times website are most likely looking to read. It can be difficult to know where to look first.<br>

Images are spread throughout the homepage, a wide variety of photos, GIFs, and original graphics showing statistics or polling results. Every image is extremely high quality, and looks nice on the screen.</p>

        When reading an article, the text is centered in the middle of the page, appearing in a column that appears to take up about a third of the screen. This further mimics the experience of reading a newspaper, where articles are laid out in columns. White space surrounds these columns, making the reading experience easier and guiding the reader’s eyes to the article. <br>

An extra level of convenience is added to the reading experience by adding a “related articles” box in the middle of the piece. For this article, this box provides extra reporting about cats. This encourages users to keep using the site and keep reading, and perhaps start a subscription once they run out of articles. This layout captures the reader’s attention and keeps them on the site.

        On the homepage, there is little obvious hierarchy. This can make it quite overwhelming, and makes it more difficult to know what to read first. Perhaps this is on purpose, and is intended to allow the user to “create their own journey” through the site. It also communicates just how much reporting the New York Times publishes, and positions them as a go-to source for a variety of topics.<br>

However, from a design standpoint, it can make the website difficult to navigate. The section titles in the header are extremely tiny, and can be easily missed if you’re looking to navigate to a certain section. There are lines dividing article preview boxes in some cases, but not all. A running column on the right side lists articles, next to a much wider column on the left listing others. It is hard to know where to look. In some cases, only a photo and a headline preview an article, but in others, there’s a longer blurb. It does create somewhat of a hierarchy of which articles are most important, but I am not sure that’s the intended reason. Looking at the homepage of the website can feel like looking at a Pinterest board: there’s no clear way to sift through everything in order.<br>

The fonts and colors, however, are consistent throughout the website. The typeface is very readable, and the main colors are black and white. This makes reading very easy. Some pops of color draw attention to special text elements, such as using blue and red on the homepage when talking about the upcoming election.

        For the UX, the reading experience on the New York Times website is flawless. It makes intuitive sense to scroll to keep reading, and there’s no annoying “click to read the rest”. On the homepage, as mentioned earlier, the navigation is not exactly user-friendly. The dropdowns for each section are very small, and fold out into an even broader navigation menu. With so many sections of the website, it is understandable that the navigation is a bit complicated. However, I think it would be helpful to make the navigation text larger. <br>

I think the design of the homepage could be improved by creating a more consistent grid system. Keeping the consistent column on the right, and then dividing the wider column on the left into a more regular grid would make it easier to navigate the headlines. It would also help the reader to know that they’ve reading everything, rather than skipping around the page through the different boxes. There is also a lack of consistency with white space on the homepage, and creating a system with the white space would make everything more cohesive.
