            <p>
            I have often talked in this class about my fondness for the early internet – tumblr themes, forum signatures, and Webkinz – and I’ve always had a love for html and css. This semester, outside of this class, has been incredibly stressful (I’m a graduating senior) and I’ve been lucky to find myself looking forward to completing my assignments for this class. I feel relaxed when I’m coding these websites, and I enjoy the creative outlet it provides. </p>
            <p>All this to say, I think the web design skills I’ve developed in this class will further my creative growth. I feel like I’m collaging, but without having to take out scissors and glue. I think making these fun websites will be a relaxing activity I return to.</p>
            <p>As I’m pursuing jobs in the writing and media world, a lot of them say knowledge of HTML and CSS is a plus. It’s definitely helpful to be able to add them to my resume, and I want to dive deeper into the intersection of HTML and SEO, since apparently you can’t just write these days, you have to know how to get clicks.</p>
            <p>I am satisfied with the work I’ve produced. I think some of my websites look janky, but hey, I’m not using Squarespace. I’d like to dive deeper into making things look very professional, and possibly creative a portfolio from scratch to showcase my skills. I’m looking forward to creating my Project 4, and I have a really clear vision of what I want to make. I want to dedicate a lot of time to making everything super uniform and clean.</p>
            <p>I think my perspective has changed on digital art as we’re seeing an overall resurgence of the Y2K aesthetic, and I am begging for that to include the internet’s design as well! As I’ve been creating these scrappy websites, I’ve found the merit in these early-internet looking sites. I’ve also gained a whole new appreciation for web designers who work completely from scratch. The creativity and right brain flexibility needed to keep everything organized is seriously impressive.</p>
            <p>I do plan to use my skills in the future! I want to work on making a new portfolio from scratch to showcase my writing. I think it will give me an extra edge in applications to say “look, I can do both!” I also want to keep building my HTML skills for SEO optimization purposes, since that’s a big thing employers are looking for.</p>
            <p>Overall, I have really enjoyed this class and being able to learn such a foundational skill.</p>
