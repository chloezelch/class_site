      I fully believe that one of the greatest luxuries in life is a great pair of sweatpants. There is truly no better feeling than putting a thick, heavy, quality pair of lounge pants after a long day. The best ones are structured enough to wear outside and still look put-together. Supreme is an expert in producing this rare breed.<br>
      An aspect of Supreme's range that is severely underrated is their pants. They are quite expensive, but their quality matches the tag. My favorite piece of this season, however, is a pair of Nike denim shorts.

      My jaw fell to the floor when I laid eyes on these Nike collab shorts. Summer 2024 is for wearing long jorts, and long jorts only. I've been coveting a pair of Nike jeans from the early 2000s that I keep getting an eBay ad for, and I have prayed nearly every day for Nike to begin making denim pieces again. In three classic washes, I'm aiming to collect 'em all. Call me Ash Ketchum. <br>
      Known for being a skating and streetwear brand, it makes perfect sense that Supreme has several windbreaker-type pants for sale. The inset-link track pants are a standout, in unqiue and interesting colorways -- an all black, a red and white (get it?), and a purple and white. The link design stitching on the side of the pants elevates a basic piece. The satin track pants are similarly standout, showcasing deep jewel tones. I do believe these pants would fit better in a F/W collection based on the colorways. <br>
      The wrapped sweatpants are without question the best lounge pants of the season. The colorways are neutral and basic, and look put together enough to wear outside of the house. Plus, who doesn't like a butt print?
