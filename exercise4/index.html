    <h1>The Web's Grain Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        We started at the beginning. I am a child of the 2000s – post dial-up, pre iPhone – and I remember the chubby desktop my parents designated in the basement so my sister and I could play Webkinz. I was really good at scamming people out of rare items and playing the Flash games to make enough money to keep expanding my house outwards and outwards. I had a room for each of my Webkinz pets, kitchens (plural), bathrooms, sky-decks, and underwater rooms. It got super complicated and frustrating, crossing the line of gross wealth into being too much to handle.<br>
        <br>

The death of Flash hit me hard. I spent hours and hours on girlsgogames, Animal Jam, and Webkinz. This intensely nostalgic piece of internet magic was ripped out of my hands. To me, this was the moment technology went too far. What were we doing? I related to Chimero’s experience of losing my sense of wonder I once felt when logging on for the first time.<br><br>

Chimero discusses how we crave the consistency and simplicity of web design that we have come to expect. The inherent rules of the web (grids, a vertical layout) are important, in my opinion, for digestion. The internet has so much to offer us, and we can truly only take it all in when we follow these conventional standards.<br><br>

Of course, innovation is important. But I loved Chimero’s example of the MacBook Pro website that went against a web user’s instincts and was lagging on an expensive laptop. Why does everything have to break the mold so aggressively – to go against the grain? As Chimero says, we have to build with the web, and not upon the web. The loss of Flash felt like building upon the lab rather than with it. I’m sure there are plenty of complicated technological reasons for losing Flash, but frankly, I don’t care. We could have built with this magical piece of technology that brought browser gaming to Gen Z, that holds some of our fondest memories. Now, you have to download an application to play Webkinz. The magic of the internet is gone from it.<br><br>

It creates edges, as Chimero explained. There was no longer a sense of vastness and expansion. Everything is housed on one application. When Chimero posed the question “What is technology’s role in your life?”, I couldn’t think of a solid answer. I grew up with technology all around me, learning how to use computers in kindergarten and messing around on my Nintendo DS. It’s an extension of my life, and it pretty much always has been. I think technology is inherently edgeless for people my age, because we’ve been raised to integrate it into everything we do.<br><br>

My grossly luxurious Webkinz house sprawled out in a grid, and it was always expanding. I created my own space on the web before I knew what coding was. I kept building with it, not on it, and I think applying this mentality to website design is important. Everything flows together, and owes its next iteration to what came before.
