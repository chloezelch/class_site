        <h1>Journal About Websites on a Website Functioning as a Journal</h1>

        <div class="content"><p>When I was little, I made a Wix account and tried to make a website about saving big cats from extinction. I've always been fascinated by the internet and its construction.</p>
        <p>I've also always been a crafter at heart. I knit, I crochet, I sew, and I was taught by my grandmother. Ursula K. Le Guin's "Rant On Technology" therefore really spoke to me. It is technological to turn a ball of yarn into a sweater, or to turn a yard of fabric into a quilt. I think it's important to remember that technology did not begin with the first IBM computer.</p>
        <p>Schwulst's article really spoke to the part of me that created that first website on Wix. It was imperfect, never finished, but it was a part of me put online. It was a projection of my dreams to save tigers from extinction. Now, I've had about three different portfolio websites that have been abandoned, and have created new ones when the time feels right, or when I've started applying to different types of jobs. I can definitely relate the sentiments Schwulst brings up.</p>
        <p>J.R. Carpenter's "A Handmade Web" spoke to me the most, as it reminded me of my days in middle school ripping HTML from other websites to create fan forum signatures and Tumblr blog themes. I had no idea what I was doing, but the handmade, collage-like quality of this work allowed me to take part in shaping my experience with the web. Carpenter's description of editing Taroko George's source code reminded me of these simpler times interacting with the building blocks behind the web.
